# Web Exploitation

During the time spent as a web application penetration tester, I've encountered thousand of interesting things.
However, some of them were so interesting I decided to build up some mini-courses, which can help others to study the same topics without spending hours grabbing the adequate material.

_As I do not have a lot of free time, I will release a new one as soon as I have enough time to finish it._
